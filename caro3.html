              <p>The lion is a wild terrestrial animal called the king of the forest. The lion is a strong animal with a strong body, a big head, a majestic mane,<br>and two fierce eyes. Lions are predatory animals and eat only after hunting. They have strong claws and sharp teeth, which help them hunt their prey and eat the flesh.Lions are considered endangered animals because humans hunt and kill them for their skin, bones and mane. Lions are also kept in zoos, away from the wildlife,where they become unhappy.Therefore, lions must be protected from being hunted down and killed by humans. After all, this majestic animal is a symbol of power, honour and pride and should be preserved for future generations to behold their beauty and grace. </p>
